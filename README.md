# Credit Default Prediction

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will default on their credit card payment in the upcoming month. The dataset used originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising 30,000 records and 23 features related to demographic and financial attributes. The target variable Y indicates default status:

1 â€” client is expected to default
0 â€” client is expected to pay on time

ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration Structure

The project is a collaborative effort among three contributors, each exploring different modeling approaches. The repository is organized with separate branches for each contributor's work. 

Each branch includes individual code, notebooks, and results. The main branch serves as a central reference point without containing executable code.

ðŸ“ˆ Project Goals

- Implement and compare various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to predict credit card defaults.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Address class imbalance issues and explore techniques like oversampling or advanced algorithms (e.g., XGBoost) for improvement.
